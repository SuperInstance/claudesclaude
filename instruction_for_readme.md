refine the following for the readme.md on the initial page of the repo: 
two hemispheres of the  agent's brain. The left hemisphere is typically associated with logical reasoning, analytical thinking, and language processing, while the right hemisphere is linked to creativity, intuition, and spatial abilities. Together, these hemispheres work in tandem to enable the agent to process information, make decisions, and interact with its environment effectively. The integration of both hemispheres allows the agent to balance rational thought with creative problem-solving, leading to a more versatile and adaptable AI system. In designing such an agent, developers often aim to mimic this dual-hemisphere structure to enhance the agent's cognitive capabilities and overall performance. The Left claude instance is where the user inputs there prompts. the left claude code instance then adds this to a markdown log of prompts and annotates the prompt with inferred references to earlier prompts from the markdown logs. The left instence then converts this annotated markdown into a2a and sends it to the right claude instance who is the actual foreman for the agent team building the project. this two instance system allows for the developer to existed one extra abstraction from the actual project building foreman. and the first claude instance is designed to get better and better at understanding the intent of the user over time by building a log of previous prompts and interactions. this agent is functionally the a2ui and a2a link. the right claude instance, deals only in a2a and coding languages. the developer enters their prompt inthe left claude instance, the the developer sees the claude instance store the prompt in markdown log format with annotations and inferred references to earlier prompts. the left claude instance then converts this markdown log into a2a format and sends it to the right claude instance. the prompt appears in the right instance and waits 3 seconds (by default) before sending to give the user a chance to interupt to read more carefully before senting to the foreman. the developer can click on the foreman and interupt at any time as well. the right claude instance then builds the project as per the developer's instructions (translated into a2a by the left claude instance). this allows for a clear separation of concerns, with the left claude instance focusing on understanding and interpreting user intent, while the right claude instance focuses on executing the technical aspects of project development. system allows for a clear separation of concerns, with the left claude instance focusing on understanding and interpreting user intent, while the right claude instance focuses on executing the technical aspects of project development. This dual-instance architecture enhances the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the agent, enabling it to better serve the needs of developers by providing a more intuitive and responsive interface for project creation and management. the two agents can mcp to a database to store their logs and interactions for future reference and learning. cloudflare is one example of where a user can store both markdown logs and a2a logs for future reference and learning. as well as embedding models to help the left claude instance get better at understanding user intent over time. and the rigtht claude instance can use code analysis models to get better at building projects over time.The two hemispheres of the agent's brain work together to create a seamless experience for the developer, allowing them to focus on their creative vision while the agent handles the technical execution. This collaborative approach separates the NLP and coding aspects of the project, ensuring that each hemisphere can specialize in its respective domain. By leveraging the strengths of both hemispheres, the agent can provide a more comprehensive and effective solution for developers, ultimately leading to higher quality projects and a more satisfying development experience.

# Dual-Hemisphere Agent Architecture
This repository implements a dual-hemisphere architecture for an AI agent, inspired by the human brain's left and right hemispheres. In Humans, left hemisphere focuses on logical reasoning, analytical thinking, and language processing, while the right hemisphere emphasizes creativity, intuition, and spatial abilities. Together, these hemispheres enable the agent to process information, make decisions, and interact with its environment effectively. in our system, we have two distinct Claude instances that work in tandem to enhance the agent's cognitive capabilities and overall performance.``````````````

Go on to explain the project...''''''''''''''

Also, read. "Intention is all you need" in our docs folder and rewrite it to be more concise and punchy and tailored for our project. that version is for a different project but we can adapt it here.
