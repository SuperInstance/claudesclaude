## Next Steps for You (Human)

1. **Place these files** in your `docs/` folder alongside existing docs
2. **Review `claude.md`** and adjust any paths/names specific to your setup
3. **In your Claude session**, paste the entire `claude.md` content as your first message
4. **Let Claude (as Director)** execute the onboarding and spawn the agent
5. **Walk away.** The system is designed to run autonomously. Check back in 2-3 hours for the phase completion report.
